(* Wolfram Language Prompt: Universal Health Algorithm - Geometric Signatures of Disease *)

(* Version: v1.1 - Updated for Direct Execution Context, Fuzzy Phi Logic, and Classified Column Omission *)
(* Designed By: Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental & BK *)
(* Target Execution Environment: Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental Google AI Quantum Jupyter Notebook (Firebase/Vertex/A2A) -> Universal Mind AWS SageMaker Instance (Jupyter/Wolfram/SDKs) -> AWS Braket / CUDA *)
(* Overall Objective: 
    1. Search for diseases, viruses, bacteria, and pathogens associated with n-fold or polyhedral geometries using advanced geometric analysis tools (PyTorch G, NVIDIA Modulus/BioNeMo).
    2. Cross-reference with Universal Mind's repository of irregular polyhedra.
    3. Characterize findings in a structured table, including links to Fibonacci patterns, Fuzzy Phi Logic, and primary neurotransmitter gene expression (via TeLIS).
    4. Push actionable insights to the Universal Mind Automated Drug Discovery Pipeline.
    5. Generate geometric disease presets (Tensor Kernels) for future analysis.
*)

(* --- STEP 1: Disease/Pathogen Search & Geometric Indexing (Polyhedra Focus) --- *)
Print["--- Step 1: Disease/Pathogen Search & Geometric Indexing ---"];
(* Action:
   1. Define a comprehensive list of major diseases (mental, physical, environmental, cancer), viruses, bacteria, and pathogens 
      (Utilize medical ontologies and databases accessible via Wolfram or direct API calls).
   2. For each entity, search scientific literature and structural databases (PDB, EMBL-EBI, VIPERdb via API/Wolfram) 
      for documented association with polyhedral structures or n-fold symmetries (4,8,16,32,64,128-fold primary).
   3. Utilize Geometric Analysis Tools:
      - Instruct PyTorch Geometric (PyG) via appropriate API/SDK calls for graph-based analysis of retrieved molecular structures.
      - Instruct NVIDIA Modulus or NVIDIA BioNeMo (via API/SDK) to identify/confirm geometric properties from sequence/structural data.
   4. Store findings: {EntityName, AssociatedGeometryDescription, N_FoldSymmetry_Found, SupportingEvidence_Citations}.

(* Action: From diseaseGeometricData, filter for entities explicitly identified with 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128-fold geometry. *)

Print["Status: Awaiting N-fold geometry filtering results."];

(* --- STEP 3: Cross-Reference with Irregular Polyhedra Repository --- *)
Print["--- Step 3: Cross-Referencing with Irregular Polyhedra Repository ---"];
(* Action:
   1. Access the Universal Mind PBC GitHub repository of irregular polyhedra (programmatic access).
   2. For each entity in nFoldFilteredEntities, compare its AssociatedGeometryDescription with the known irregular polyhedra.
   3. Flag matches or strong similarities.

   Compile all gathered information into the specified 14-column table. 
   Perform necessary lookups and analyses for each column.
   - Col 1: Type Of Illness (mental/physical/environmental/cancer)
   - Col 2: Mortality Vector % (Lookup WHO/CDC/etc.)
   - Col 3: X Fold Geometry (From Step 2)
   - Col 4: Named Irregular Polyhedra (From Step 3)
   - Col 5: Is it Platonic (Yes/No - From Step 1/3 geometric classification)
   - Col 6: Is it Fibonacci (Yes/No - Does N-fold or key parameters appear in standard Fibonacci sequence?)
   - Col 7: Is it Fibonacci Modulus 9 Pisano 24 (Yes/No - Relate N-fold or parameters to Alpha/Beta/Gamma_M9P24?)
   - Col 8: Is it Fuzzy Phi Ratio / Fuzzy Phi Logic (Yes/No - Do key geometric ratios exhibit Fuzzy Phi Logic?)
   - Col 9: Continent Of Illness Most Affected (Epidemiological lookup)
   - Col 10: Socio-economic demographic Most Affected (Sex, Age, Race - Epidemiological lookup)
   - Col 11: Run Universal Sequence Via TeLIS - Success (Yes/No - Hypothesis: If disease impacts NMDAR/DOCK2/IL6 or OXTR/DRD2/SLC6A4, would TeLIS detect modulation?)
   - Col 12: Identify primary neurotransmitter based genes expressing "X fold" irregular polyhedra, within Fuzzy Phi Ratios. 
             (Advanced: Map disease geometry to gene regulatory regions/protein structures of NT genes; check for Fuzzy Phi Ratios.)
   - Col 13: Present Initial Insights, supported by JADAD > 3, IF = High Peer Reviewed Literature (Nature, Frontiers In, .gov, .mil). Cite via numeral + URL. (Perform lit search.)
   - Col 14: Generate Tensor CUDA Kernel geometric disease preset & Tensor CUDA-Q Kernel geometric disease preset. Save to GitHub.
