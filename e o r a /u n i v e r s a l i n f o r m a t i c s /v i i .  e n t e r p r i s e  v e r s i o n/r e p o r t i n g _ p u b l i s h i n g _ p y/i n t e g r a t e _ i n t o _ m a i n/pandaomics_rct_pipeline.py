PandaOmics RCT Pipeline for Universal Informatics

This module integrates PandaOmics with DORA and GPTo3 to create a robust
RCT design pipeline with JADAD and IF scoring using Fuzzy Phi Logic for
quality assessment.

The pipeline ensures that genomic research meets Universal Mind's standards
while allowing for frontier innovation through quality-based discretion.

# GPTo3 Briefing: PandaOmics RCT Pipeline Integration

## Overview
The PandaOmics RCT Pipeline integrates JADAD scoring and Impact Factor analysis with Fuzzy Phi Logic to create genomic research designs that meet Universal Mind's strict standards while allowing for frontier innovation through quality-based discretion.

## Key Components
1. **Research Design Agent**: Provides JADAD scoring and Impact Factor analysis
2. **PandaOmics InSilico Agent**: Executes virtual RCTs with comprehensive genomic assessments
3. **InClinicio AI**: Validates designs using integrated quality metrics
4. **Fuzzy Phi Logic**: Calculates Scientific Significance based on Platonic geometries and biological importance
5. **Universal Research Design Integrator**: Connects all components into a unified system

## Quality Standards for Publication
- **Nature Journals**: JADAD ≥ 4, WSS ≥ 8, Integrated Quality Score ≥ 7
- **Frontiers Journals**: JADAD ≥ 3, WSS ≥ 5, Integrated Quality Score ≥ 5

## Fuzzy Phi Logic Calculation
The Scientific Significance is calculated as:
- P = Count of Platonic geometries nested in the transcribed circle of Pisano Period
- WSS = Weighted Scientific Significance based on biological importance
- SS = P × WSS (normalized to scale 1-10)

## WSS Categories
- **High (8-10)**: Creates cellular life - primary life functions (chlorophyll creation, biosynthesis, cellular duplication, transcription, methylation)
- **Medium (5-7)**: Supports cellular life - molecular docking, protein folding, quantum coherence, quantum tunnelling
- **Low (1-4)**: Creates elemental life - electron/proton/neutron spin/rotation/orbit

## Implementation Workflow
1. Design phase: Create study design with PandaOmics, validate with JADAD and Fuzzy Phi
2. Execution phase: Run virtual RCT with quality controls
3. Publication phase: Generate manuscript optimized for target journals

## Command Example
```python
# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = PandaOmicsRctPipeline(api_keys)

# Design genomic RCT
rct_design = await pipeline.design_genomic_rct(
    genes=["BRCA1", "TP53", "EGFR"],
    condition="Breast Cancer",
    target_journals=["Nature Methods", "Frontiers in Bioinformatics"]
)

# Execute with quality controls
results = await pipeline.execute_rct_with_quality_controls(rct_design)

# Generate publication
publication = await pipeline.generate_publication_from_rct(results)
```

## Integration with DORA
The pipeline integrates with DORA for manuscript generation, ensuring that the final publication maintains the quality standards established during the research design phase. DORA is briefed with the quality metrics and Research Vector components to optimize the manuscript for the target journals.

## Research Design Guardrails
Every research design is validated against Universal Mind's strict guardrails:
1. Methodological robustness (JADAD score)
2. Scientific significance (Fuzzy Phi Logic)
3. Publication viability (Impact Factor analysis)

These guardrails ensure that all research meets the standards for publication in high-impact journals while allowing for frontier innovation through quality-based discretion.
