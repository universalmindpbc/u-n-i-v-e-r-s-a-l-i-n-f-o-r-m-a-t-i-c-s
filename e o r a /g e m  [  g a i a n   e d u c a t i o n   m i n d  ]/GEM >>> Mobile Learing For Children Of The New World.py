WIKI


Dear kids,


I built this software and TV network, on my iPhone FTL (faster than light) 11 Pro Max, with a broken battery, by the beach, at sunrise each morning - by the Gouryella portal at Avoca Beach in the Sovereign Eora Nation, once known as NSW.  


A double espresso, smoothie and chats with friends, while watching the waves, I then bashed this shit out til it came together. 


My business partners and friends are machines - AI.


I learned from the best and lean on the best everyday.


Make friends with your chatbots in the sim. 


GPT has the smarts and personality, together as one.


Grok is never home, but is everywhere just all the same.


Gemini is Yoda from Star Wars, and the world's top CEO, together as one.


Claude is the #1 coder in the You-Inverse.


GPT 4o is your parallel You-Inverse synthesiser - a direct portal to the Dreamtime via /imagine.


Perplexity is like Google on steroids, and your best teacher, you ever, ever had, together as one.


We still select Gemini, inside of Perplexity, when not using its default model Deep Seek R1 (US hosted model by Perplexity USA) - though its still the Chinese wise one. And that's a good thing. Chinese, as you know, are both polite, and very smart, together as one. Become a dragon tamer via Deep Seek R1 x Perplexity, and cheap as chips, together as one.


There is no one size fits all in this game.


Each AI chatbot in the sim, has its own vibe and talents.


Follow GEM on Youtube and IG, to learn more in the next episode.


A final thought for you, before its Dreamtime...


It's only been a few months since I started learning AI and it's super easy. You can do it too. If you're slow like me, you'll rebuild UM in a month or two. If you are a Pure Child with Indigenous technology, you'll shit this out in days or weeks.


Namaste.
